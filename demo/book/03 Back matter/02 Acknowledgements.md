# Acknowledgements {.unlisted .clean}

This is an example of a front/back-matter page in the "clean" style, i.e. without any running header or page-numbering, but still using the prose style of indented paragraphs.

I’d like to thank my wife, Someone, for her love and support as always.  I couldn’t do this without her.

I’d also like to thank our children, who remind me to celebrate all the good things in the world.

Most of all, dear reader, my thanks go to you.
