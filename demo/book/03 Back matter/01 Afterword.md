# Afterword {.unlisted .unindented .recto}

Dear Reader,

Thank you so much for reaching this page. I’m %author%, the author of this book. This letter is for you.

I hope you’ve enjoyed reading _%title%_. I appreciate the investment of time and trust you’ve made. Writing is a tough job; what makes it worthwhile is the idea that someone, somewhere, is reading your words.

If you enjoyed the book, I’d be very grateful if you left a brief review on the online store of your choice. Authors live and die by those reviews. A minute of your time would mean a great deal to me.

I’d also love to hear from you, and keep you informed about new books, behind-the-scenes articles on writing, bonus and deleted chapters, and more. Here’s how we can stay in touch:
